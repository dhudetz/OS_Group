/**
 * These are your "quanta's". 
 *
 * The "preempt" quantum indicates when the scheduler should preempt.
 * For example, if the QUANTUM is 3, then after 3 clock ticks, the scheduler will preempt
 * and then reset the value of the preempt quantum to QUANTUM.
 *
 * The "promote_medium" quantum indicates when a medium priority process ("PRIORITY_MED")
 * should get promoted and become a high priority process ("PRIORITY_HIGH").
 * The promote_medium quantum should decrement when resched() is called and AGING is TRUE.
 *
 * The "promote_low" quantum indicates when a low priority process ("PRIORITY_LOW")
 * should get promoted and become a medium prority process. This quantum should be decremented
 * every time a medium priority process is promoted.
 *
 * NOTE: The quantums are array's because there is one for each core.
 *       When accessing these, the proper way to do so would be to 
 *       use the cpuid as an index.
 *
 * NOTE2: The "promote_medium[]" and "promote_low[]" quantum's should only be used
 *        when AGING is set to TRUE.
 *
 * NOTE3: All of theses quantum's have a reset value of QUANTUM (#defined above this).
 *        Therefore, when these reach 0, they should be reset to that value.
